Hi, I'm **Jason**, a Cyber Security Student working as an IT-Security Specialist with a passion for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and red teaming.

Before transitioning into tech, I worked as an electrician and earned a **Bachelor’s Professional degree in Electrical Engineering**.  
In 2023, I decided to shift my focus and began studying for a **Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity** to build a strong academic foundation in the field.

That change sparked my deep interest in **penetration testing** and **red teaming**. Since then, I've been learning hands-on through platforms like **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and other real-world labs.
