## 🧠 A Place to Learn in Public

For the longest time, I’ve been learning and exploring in silence — working through machines on HackTheBox and TryHackMe, taking notes locally, and moving on to the next thing. But over time I realized something important:

> **If you don’t write it down, you’ll forget. If you don’t share it, you won’t grow.**

This blog is my answer to that realization.

## ✍️ Why I’m Starting This Blog

I’m building this blog to:

- **Improve my note-taking and documentation skills.**  
  Writing clear, structured walkthroughs is essential in InfoSec and will also help me in my day-to-day work.

- **Track my personal growth.**  
  Over time, I want to look back and see how much I’ve learned — not just technically, but also in how I explain and communicate ideas.

- **Build a public portfolio.**  
  This blog will showcase my thinking process, persistence, and problem-solving ability — useful for future opportunities in security or tech.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

To start with, I’ll mainly post:

- Write-ups for **HackTheBox** and **TryHackMe** machines  
- Notes and thoughts on **courses**, **certifications**, and learning paths  
- Occasionally some posts on tools, workflows, or tips I find helpful

## 🎯 Long-Term Goal

This is more than just a blog. It’s my digital lab notebook — where I learn, reflect, and grow in public.

If you stumble across this and find anything useful (or want to exchange ideas), feel free to reach out.

Let’s hack, learn, and grow — one post at a time.
